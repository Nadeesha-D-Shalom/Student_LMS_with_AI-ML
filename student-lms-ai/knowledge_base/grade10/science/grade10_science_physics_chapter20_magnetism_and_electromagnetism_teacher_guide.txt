Grade 10 Science – Physics
Chapter 20: Magnetism and Electromagnetism

Magnetism:
Magnetism is the ability of certain materials to attract iron and other magnetic materials.

Magnets:
A magnet attracts iron, nickel and cobalt.

Magnetic Poles:
Every magnet has:
- North pole
- South pole

Like poles repel each other.
Unlike poles attract each other.

Magnetic Field:
The region around a magnet where magnetic force acts is called a magnetic field.

Magnetic Field Lines:
- Originate from north pole
- End at south pole
- Do not intersect
- Closer lines indicate stronger field

Electromagnetism:
An electric current flowing through a conductor produces a magnetic field.

Electromagnets:
Temporary magnets produced by passing current through a coil around a soft iron core.

Factors affecting strength of electromagnet:
- Number of turns of the coil
- Strength of current
- Core material

Uses of Electromagnets:
- Electric bells
- Relays
- Electric cranes
- Loudspeakers

Permanent Magnets:
Retain magnetism for a long time.

Uses of Permanent Magnets:
- Compasses
- Motors
- Loudspeakers

Electromagnetic Induction:
Electric current is produced when magnetic fields change.

Applications:
- Electric generators
- Transformers

Summary:
- Magnets have two poles
- Current produces magnetic fields
- Electromagnets are temporary
- Induction is used to generate electricity
