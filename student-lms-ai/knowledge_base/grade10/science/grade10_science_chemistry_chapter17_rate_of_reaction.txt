Chapter 17: Rate of Reaction

The cause of most changes around us is chemical reactions. Some examples of chemical changes are:
- Rusting of iron
- Ripening of fruits
- Digestion of food
- Manufacturing yoghurt from milk
- Burning firewood
- Reaction of zinc with dilute acid
- Reaction of sodium metal with water
- Ignition of petrol
- Blast of a cracker

The speeds of chemical reactions are different. Some reactions occur very fast while others are very slow.
Reactions such as rusting of iron, digestion of food and ripening of fruits are slow reactions.
Reactions such as combustion of petrol, reaction of zinc with acid and blasting of crackers are fast reactions.

Rate of Reaction:
When a chemical reaction occurs, reactants are used up and products are formed.
The rate of reaction is defined as the amount of change occurring per unit time.

Rate of reaction =
Amount of reactants used up / Time taken
or
Amount of products formed / Time taken

Determination of Rate of Reaction:
The rate of a reaction can be determined by:
1. Measuring the amount of reactants used up or products formed in a given time
2. Measuring the time taken for a given amount of reactants to be used up or products to be formed

Factors Affecting the Rate of Reactions:
When a reaction occurs, particles of reactants must collide with each other.
The rate of reaction depends on the frequency of effective collisions.

The main factors affecting the rate of reaction are:
- Surface area of reactants
- Temperature of the reaction
- Concentration of reactants (pressure for gases)
- Presence of catalysts

Surface Area of Reactants:
When a solid reacts with a liquid or gas, the reaction occurs only at the surface.
Increasing the surface area increases the number of collisions, thus increasing the rate of reaction.

Temperature:
Increasing temperature increases the kinetic energy of particles.
This increases the number of effective collisions per unit time.
Therefore, the rate of reaction increases with temperature.

Concentration of Reactants:
Increasing the concentration increases the number of reactant particles in a unit volume.
This increases collision frequency and hence increases the rate of reaction.

Pressure of Gaseous Reactants:
For gaseous reactants, increasing pressure increases the rate of reaction by increasing collision frequency.

Catalysts:
Catalysts are substances that increase the rate of a reaction without being consumed.
Catalysts remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.

Inhibitors:
Substances that decrease the rate of reaction are called inhibitors.

Uses of Rate of Reaction:
Knowledge of rate of reaction is important in:
- Chemical industries
- Industrial processes
- Day-to-day activities

Summary:
- Rate of reaction is the amount of change per unit time
- Rate depends on surface area, temperature, concentration and catalysts
- Catalysts speed up reactions without being consumed
