Chapter 19: Current Electricity

Electricity is a very important form of energy. In the modern world, many instruments
are manufactured to operate using electricity. Household equipment such as electric
bulbs, electric irons and electric fans are examples.

Electricity exists in two forms:
- Static electricity
- Current electricity

Static Electricity:
Static electricity consists of electric charges accumulated on the surfaces of objects.
These charges do not flow.

When certain objects are rubbed, they acquire the ability to attract small pieces of
paper or light materials. This is due to static electric charges produced by rubbing.

Atoms consist of electrons, protons and neutrons.
- Protons are positively charged
- Electrons are negatively charged
- Neutrons have no charge

Only electrons can be removed easily from atoms.
When electrons are transferred during rubbing:
- Loss of electrons → positive charge
- Gain of electrons → negative charge

Charges that remain stationary on an object are called electrostatic charges.

Electric Current:
When electrostatic charges begin to move, an electric current is produced.
An electric current is the flow of electric charges through a conductor.

Conductors:
Materials that allow electric current to pass easily are called conductors.
Metals such as copper, aluminium and iron are good conductors.

Metals contain free electrons in their outermost shells.
These free electrons move when a potential difference is applied.

Direction of Current:
Actual electron flow occurs from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.
Conventionally, electric current is considered to flow from the positive terminal
to the negative terminal.

Electric Current Unit:
The SI unit of electric current is the ampere (A).
The instrument used to measure current is the ammeter.

Potential Difference:
The electric pressure difference between two points in a circuit is called the
potential difference.
Unit: Volt (V)

Electromotive Force (EMF):
The force by which electrons are supplied to a circuit by a source is called the
electromotive force.

Voltmeter:
The instrument used to measure potential difference is the voltmeter.
A voltmeter is connected in parallel with the component.

Ohm’s Law:
When the temperature of a conductor is constant, the current passing through it
is directly proportional to the potential difference across it.

V ∝ I
V = IR

Where:
V = potential difference
I = current
R = resistance

Resistance:
Resistance is the property that opposes the flow of electric current.
Unit: Ohm (Ω)

Factors affecting resistance:
- Length of the conductor
- Cross-sectional area
- Material of the conductor

Resistors:
Components used to control current in a circuit.
Types of resistors:
- Fixed resistors
- Variable resistors
- Light dependent resistors

Combination of Resistors:
Series combination:
R = R₁ + R₂ + R₃

Parallel combination:
1/R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃

Electric Shock:
Electric shock occurs when the human body becomes part of an electric circuit.
A potential difference and a complete path are required for current to flow.

Summary:
- Electric current is the flow of charges
- Current is measured in amperes
- Ohm’s law relates V, I and R
- Resistance controls current flow
