Grade 10 Science – Physics
Chapter 18: Work, Energy and Power

Work:
An object is said to have done work if its position or shape changes under the action of a force.

If a constant force moves an object through a distance in the direction of the force, work is done.

Work done = Force × Displacement in the direction of the force

Unit of work: Joule (J)

Examples:
If a force of 1 N moves an object by 1 m, work done is 1 J.
If a force of 2 N moves an object by 1 m, work done is 2 J.

Energy:
Energy is the ability to do work.
The unit of energy is the joule (J).

Forms of energy:
- Heat energy
- Electrical energy
- Mechanical energy
- Light energy
- Sound energy

Mechanical Energy:
There are two forms of mechanical energy:
- Kinetic energy
- Potential energy

Kinetic Energy:
The energy possessed by an object due to its motion is called kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy depends on:
- Mass of the object
- Velocity of the object

Kinetic energy = 1/2 mv²

Unit: Joule (J)

Potential Energy:
The energy stored in an object due to its position or change in shape is called potential energy.

Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored due to height.

Potential energy = mgh

Where:
m = mass
g = acceleration due to gravity
h = height

Elastic potential energy is stored when an object is stretched or compressed.

Transformation of Energy:
Kinetic energy can be converted into potential energy and potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy.

Examples:
- A moving bicycle climbing a hill
- A swing in motion
- Water stored in a reservoir

Power:
Power is the rate of doing work.

Power = Work done / Time taken

Unit of power: Watt (W)

1 Watt = 1 Joule per second

Examples:
If 600 J of work is done in 10 s,
Power = 600 / 10 = 60 W

Summary:
- Work is force multiplied by displacement
- Energy is the ability to do work
- Mechanical energy exists as kinetic and potential energy
- Power is the rate of doing work
