Grade 10 Science – Biology
Chapter 06: Structure and Functions of the Plant and Animal Cell

6.1 Basic Unit of Life

In 1665, Robert Hooke observed cork cells using a microscope.
He discovered that living organisms are made up of small units called cells.

Cell theory states:
- The cell is the structural and functional unit of life.
- All organisms are made up of one or more cells.
- New cells arise from pre-existing cells.

6.2 Concept of the Cell

A cell is the smallest structural unit of a living organism.
Organisms may be unicellular or multicellular.

Cells differ in shape, size and function.
Most cells cannot be seen with the naked eye.

6.3 Structure of Cells

Animal cells and plant cells can be studied using microscopes.
Animal cells are covered by a plasma membrane.
Plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose.

6.4 Cell Organelles

Cell Wall:
Provides shape, protection and support to plant cells.

Plasma Membrane:
A semi-permeable membrane that controls movement of substances.

Cytoplasm:
Gel-like substance that contains organelles and metabolic reactions occur here.

Nucleus:
Controls all activities of the cell and stores genetic information.

Mitochondrion:
Site of aerobic respiration.
Known as the powerhouse of the cell.

Golgi Apparatus:
Involved in packaging and secretion.

Ribosomes:
Involved in protein synthesis.

Endoplasmic Reticulum:
Rough ER – transports proteins
Smooth ER – synthesizes lipids

Vacuole:
Stores water, ions and pigments.
Large central vacuole is present in plant cells.

6.5 Cell Growth and Cell Division

Cell growth is an irreversible increase in size or dry mass.

Cell division occurs by:
- Mitosis
- Meiosis

Mitosis:
Produces two identical daughter cells.
Important for growth and repair.

Meiosis:
Reduces chromosome number by half.
Important for sexual reproduction and variation.

Summary:
- Cells are the basic units of life.
- Organelles perform specific functions.
- Mitosis and meiosis are types of cell division.
