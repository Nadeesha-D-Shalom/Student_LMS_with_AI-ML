Chapter 07: Quantification of Elements and Compounds

To measure the mass of objects such as a motor car, brick, loaf of bread or a tablet of medicine,
units like kilogram, gram and milligram are used. However, these units are too large to measure
the mass of atoms and molecules.

The mass of very small particles such as atoms and molecules is extremely small.
For example:
Mass of a hydrogen atom = 1.674 × 10⁻²⁴ g
Mass of a carbon atom = 1.993 × 10⁻²³ g
Mass of a sodium atom = 3.819 × 10⁻²³ g
Mass of a chlorine atom = 5.903 × 10⁻²³ g

Using such values is inconvenient. Therefore, the concept of relative atomic mass was introduced.

7.1 Relative Atomic Mass (Ar)

Relative atomic mass is defined as how many times the mass of an atom of an element
is heavier than 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

At present, 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 isotope is used as the atomic mass unit.

Relative atomic mass (Ar) has no unit.

Examples of relative atomic masses:
Hydrogen – 1
Carbon – 12
Oxygen – 16
Sodium – 23
Chlorine – 35.5

7.2 Relative Molecular Mass (Mr)

Relative molecular mass is the sum of the relative atomic masses of all atoms present
in a molecule.

Example:
Relative molecular mass of water (H2O)
= (2 × 1) + 16
= 18

Relative molecular mass has no unit.

7.3 Avogadro Constant

When the relative atomic mass of an element is taken in grams, it contains
6.022 × 10²³ atoms.

This number is called the Avogadro constant.

Avogadro constant = 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹

7.4 Mole

The mole is the SI unit used to measure the amount of a substance.

One mole of a substance contains 6.022 × 10²³ particles (atoms, molecules or ions).

Molar Mass:
Molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance.
Unit: g mol⁻¹

Formula:
Number of moles (n) = Mass (m) / Molar mass (M)

Summary:
- Relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass have no units.
- Mole is used to measure large numbers of particles.
- Molar mass is expressed in g mol⁻¹.
