Chapter 15: Hydrostatic Pressure and Its Applications

15.1 Pressure

Pressure is the force acting per unit area.

Pressure = Perpendicular force / Area

The unit of pressure is N m⁻², which is known as the Pascal (Pa).
Since pressure has only magnitude, it is a scalar quantity.

15.2 Hydrostatic Pressure

Liquids also exert pressure. The pressure exerted by a liquid acts in all directions.
The pressure at the same level of a liquid is the same.
The pressure in a liquid increases with depth.

Characteristics of hydrostatic pressure:
(i) Pressure increases with the height of the liquid column.
(ii) Pressure at the same level of a liquid is the same.
(iii) Pressure at a point acts in all directions.
(iv) Pressure depends on the vertical height of the liquid column and not on its shape.

Pressure due to a liquid column is given by:

P = h × ρ × g

where:
h = height of liquid column
ρ = density of liquid
g = acceleration due to gravity

15.3 Transmission of Pressure through Liquids

Liquids are nearly incompressible. Therefore, pressure applied at one point in a liquid
is transmitted equally in all directions.

Hydraulic press operates on this principle.
A small force applied on a small piston can generate a large force on a larger piston.

Applications:
- Hydraulic press
- Hydraulic jack
- Vehicle braking system

15.4 Pressure Due to Gases

Gases exert pressure.
Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of air above a surface.

Atmospheric pressure at sea level is equivalent to a mercury column of height 76 cm.

Barometers:
- Mercury barometer
- Aneroid barometer

Applications of atmospheric pressure:
- Drinking with a straw
- Siphon method
- Rubber sucker

15.5 Floatation

When an object is immersed in a liquid, an upward force acts on it.
This upward force is called upthrust.

Archimedes’ Principle:
When an object is partially or completely immersed in a liquid, the upthrust acting on it
is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the object.

If:
- Upthrust < weight → object sinks
- Upthrust = weight → object floats fully submerged
- Upthrust > weight → object floats partially submerged

Hydrometer:
Used to measure the density of liquids.
Works based on Archimedes’ principle.

Summary:
- Liquids and gases exert pressure
- Pressure increases with depth
- Atmospheric pressure exists due to air
- Floating depends on upthrust and weight
