Grade 10 Science – Chapter 01
Unit: Biology
Topic: Chemical Basis of Life

Living organisms are composed of chemical compounds formed by the bonding of naturally occurring elements. Out of 92 elements found in nature, about 25 are present in the living body.

The four most abundant elements in living organisms are Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). Other essential elements include Sulphur, Phosphorus, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, and Chlorine.

Biological Molecules:
Chemical compounds that build living matter are called biological molecules. They are classified into four main groups:
1. Carbohydrates
2. Proteins
3. Lipids
4. Nucleic Acids

Carbohydrates:
Carbohydrates are the most abundant organic compounds on Earth. They are produced during photosynthesis. Foods such as rice, potatoes, grains, sugar, and flour contain carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates are composed of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen, with Hydrogen and Oxygen in a 2:1 ratio.

Types of Carbohydrates:
- Monosaccharides: Glucose, Fructose, Galactose
- Disaccharides: Maltose, Sucrose, Lactose
- Polysaccharides: Starch, Glycogen, Cellulose

Proteins:
Proteins are complex molecules made of amino acids. They contain Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and sometimes Sulphur.
Functions of proteins include:
- Structural components of cells
- Enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions
- Hormones such as insulin
- Antibodies for immunity

Lipids:
Lipids include fats and oils. They contain Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen but with a higher hydrogen ratio.
Functions of lipids:
- Energy storage
- Formation of cell membranes
- Thermal insulation
- Protection of internal organs
- Hormone synthesis

Nucleic Acids:
Nucleic acids include DNA and RNA.
DNA stores and transmits genetic information and controls cellular activities.
RNA is involved in protein synthesis.

Water:
Water is an inorganic compound essential for life.
Functions of water include:
- Acting as a solvent
- Regulating body temperature
- Transporting nutrients and wastes
- Providing a medium for biochemical reactions

Minerals:
Minerals are required in small amounts for proper functioning of organisms.
Deficiency of minerals leads to disorders and diseases.

Vitamins:
Vitamins are organic compounds required in small quantities.
Water-soluble vitamins: B and C
Fat-soluble vitamins: A, D, E, K
Deficiency of vitamins causes specific deficiency diseases.
