Grade 10 Science – Physics
Chapter 12: Equilibrium of Forces

An object is said to be in equilibrium when the resultant force acting on it is zero.

Equilibrium under Two Forces:
An object remains in equilibrium under two forces if:
- The two forces are equal in magnitude
- The two forces act in opposite directions
- The two forces act along the same line

Examples:
- An object resting on a table
- An object suspended by a string

Equilibrium under Three Parallel Forces:
An object remains in equilibrium if:
- The three forces are coplanar
- One force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the resultant of the other two forces

Examples:
- A rod resting on two supports
- A child sitting on a swing

Equilibrium under Three Non-Parallel Forces:
An object remains in equilibrium if:
- The three forces are coplanar
- The lines of action of the forces meet at a common point
- The resultant of any two forces is equal and opposite to the third force

Examples:
- A picture frame hanging on a wall

Summary:
- Equilibrium occurs when resultant force is zero
- Conditions vary for two-force and three-force systems
- Equilibrium can exist under more than three forces
