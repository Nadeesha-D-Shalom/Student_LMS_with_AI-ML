Chapter 19: Current Electricity

Electricity exists in two forms:
- Static electricity
- Current electricity

Static Electricity:
Static electricity consists of electric charges accumulated on the surfaces of objects.
These charges do not flow.

Current Electricity:
Current electricity is the flow of electric charges through a conductor.

Electric Current:
Electric current flows due to a potential difference.
Free electrons in conductors contribute to electric current.

Direction of Current:
Electron flow occurs from negative terminal to positive terminal.
Conventional current flows from positive terminal to negative terminal.

Unit of Electric Current:
SI unit of current is the ampere (A).
Ammeter is used to measure electric current.

Potential Difference:
Potential difference is the electric pressure difference between two points in a circuit.
Unit: volt (V).
Measured using a voltmeter connected in parallel.

Electromotive Force (EMF):
EMF is the potential difference between terminals of a source when no current flows.

Resistance:
Resistance opposes the flow of electric current.
Unit: ohm (Ω).

Factors affecting resistance:
- Length of conductor
- Cross-sectional area
- Material (resistivity)

Ohm’s Law:
When temperature is constant,
V ∝ I
V = IR

Resistors:
- Fixed resistors
- Variable resistors
- Light dependent resistors

Resistor Colour Code:
Used to identify resistance values.

Combination of Resistors:
Series combination:
R = R₁ + R₂ + R₃

Parallel combination:
1/R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃

Electric Shock:
Occurs when the human body becomes part of a circuit.
Requires a potential difference and a complete path.

Summary:
- Electric current is flow of charges
- Ohm’s law relates V, I and R
- Resistance controls current
- Resistors are used to regulate circuits
