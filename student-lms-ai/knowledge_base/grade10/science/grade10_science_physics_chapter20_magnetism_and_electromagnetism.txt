Chapter 20: Magnetism and Electromagnetism

Magnetism:
Magnetism is a property by which certain materials attract iron and other magnetic
materials.

Magnets:
A magnet is an object that attracts magnetic substances such as iron, nickel and cobalt.

Magnetic Poles:
Every magnet has two poles:
- North pole
- South pole

Like poles repel each other.
Unlike poles attract each other.

Magnetic Field:
The region around a magnet where magnetic force can be experienced is called
the magnetic field.

Magnetic field lines:
- Originate from the north pole
- End at the south pole
- Do not intersect each other
- Are closer where the field is stronger

Electromagnetism:
When an electric current flows through a conductor, a magnetic field is produced
around it.

Factors affecting the strength of an electromagnet:
- Number of turns of the coil
- Strength of current
- Type of core material

Electromagnets:
An electromagnet is a temporary magnet produced by passing current through a coil
wound around a soft iron core.

Uses of Electromagnets:
- Electric bells
- Relays
- Electric cranes
- Loudspeakers

Permanent Magnets:
Magnets that retain magnetism for a long time are called permanent magnets.

Uses of Permanent Magnets:
- Compasses
- Electric motors
- Loudspeakers

Electromagnetic Induction:
The process of generating electric current by changing magnetic fields is called
electromagnetic induction.

Applications:
- Electric generators
- Transformers

Summary:
- Magnetism involves attraction and repulsion
- Current produces magnetic fields
- Electromagnets are temporary magnets
- Electromagnetic induction produces electricity
