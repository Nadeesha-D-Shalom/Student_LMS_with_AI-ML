Grade 10 Science – Physics
Chapter 05: Friction

Friction:
Friction is the force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact.

Types of Friction:
1. Static friction – acts before motion starts
2. Limiting friction – maximum static friction
3. Dynamic friction – acts when the body is in motion

Factors Affecting Limiting Friction:
- Nature of contact surfaces
- Normal reaction force

Limiting friction does not depend on surface area.

Methods of Reducing Friction:
- Polishing surfaces
- Using lubricants (oil, grease)
- Using ball bearings

Advantages of Friction:
- Enables walking
- Helps vehicles to stop
- Allows gripping objects
- Writing on paper

Disadvantages of Friction:
- Causes energy loss as heat
- Wear and tear of machines
- Reduces efficiency
