Chapter 04: Newton’s Laws of Motion

Force:
A force is a push or a pull.
Force can change shape, speed, or direction of motion.
Force is a vector quantity.

Newton’s First Law:
A body remains at rest or continues to move with uniform velocity unless an unbalanced force acts on it.

Examples:
- Objects stop due to friction
- Passengers fall forward when brakes are applied

Newton’s Second Law:
Acceleration is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass.

Formula:
F = m × a

Where:
F = force (N)
m = mass (kg)
a = acceleration (m s⁻²)

Newton’s Third Law:
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Examples:
- Walking
- Swimming
- Rocket propulsion
- Balloon movement

Momentum:
Momentum = mass × velocity
p = m × v

Unit: kg m s⁻¹
Momentum depends on mass and velocity.

Mass and Weight:
Mass is the amount of matter in an object (kg).
Weight is the force due to gravity (N).

Formula:
Weight = mass × gravitational acceleration
W = m × g

Weight changes with gravity, mass does not.
