Chapter 06: Cell Growth and Cell Division (Summary)

Cell growth is the irreversible increase in size or mass of a cell.
When a cell reaches its maximum size, it divides.

Cell division is the process by which new cells are formed.

Types of Cell Division:
1. Mitosis
2. Meiosis

Mitosis:
- Occurs in somatic cells
- Produces two identical daughter cells
- Chromosome number remains constant
- Important for growth and tissue repair

Meiosis:
- Occurs in reproductive cells
- Produces four daughter cells
- Chromosome number is halved
- Produces genetic variation

Differences between Mitosis and Meiosis:
- Mitosis has one division, meiosis has two divisions
- Mitosis produces identical cells, meiosis produces varied cells
- Mitosis maintains chromosome number, meiosis reduces it

Importance:
- Mitosis supports growth
- Meiosis supports reproduction and evolution
