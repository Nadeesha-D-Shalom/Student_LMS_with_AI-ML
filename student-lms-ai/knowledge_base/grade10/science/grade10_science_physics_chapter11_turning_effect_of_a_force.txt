Chapter 11: Turning Effect of a Force

By applying forces on objects, it is possible to push, pull or lift them. Similarly, it is possible to rotate objects by applying forces on them. That is, by applying a force we can rotate or turn an object around a given point.

The ability of a force to rotate an object around a given point is called the turning effect of a force.

Moment:
The product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the axis of rotation is known as the moment of a force.

Moment of a force = Force × Perpendicular distance
Unit: N m

The moment of a force depends on:
- The magnitude of the force
- The perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation

Clockwise and Anticlockwise Moments:
Depending on the direction of rotation, the moment can be clockwise or anticlockwise.

If clockwise moment equals anticlockwise moment, the object remains in equilibrium.

Turning Effect of a Force:
To rotate an object around an axis, a moment is required. A moment is produced when a force is applied at a distance from the axis of rotation.

Couple of Forces:
Two equal forces acting in opposite directions along parallel lines form a couple.

The resultant force of a couple is zero, but it produces rotation.

Moment of a couple = Force × Perpendicular distance between the lines of action
Unit: N m

Applications of Couples:
- Opening or closing a tap
- Turning a steering wheel
- Using a screwdriver

Summary:
- Moment causes rotation
- Moment depends on force and distance
- A couple produces rotation without linear motion
