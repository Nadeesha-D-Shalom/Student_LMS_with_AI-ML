Chapter 09: Resultant Force

When more than one force is applied on an object, the single force that gives the same result as all the contributing forces is known as the resultant force.

Resultant of Two Collinear Forces Acting in the Same Direction:
When two forces act along the same direction, the resultant force is equal to the sum of the two forces.

Resultant force = F1 + F2

Resultant of Two Collinear Forces Acting in Opposite Directions:
When two forces act in opposite directions, the resultant force is equal to the difference between the two forces and acts in the direction of the larger force.

Resultant force = Larger force − Smaller force

Resultant of Two Parallel Forces:
When two parallel forces act along the same direction, the resultant is equal to the sum of the two forces.

Resultant of Two Inclined Forces:
When two inclined forces act on an object, the resultant acts in a direction between the two forces.

Summary:
- Resultant force replaces the effect of multiple forces
- Same direction → forces add
- Opposite direction → forces subtract
- Direction of resultant is the direction of the greater force
