Grade 10 Science – Chemistry
Chapter 03: Structure of Matter

Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. Matter can be classified based on its physical nature and chemical composition.

Classification of Matter:
- Pure substances
  - Elements (e.g. Iron, Oxygen, Copper)
  - Compounds (e.g. Water, Carbon dioxide)
- Mixtures
  - Homogeneous mixtures (e.g. salt solution)
  - Heterogeneous mixtures (e.g. sand and rice)

Atom:
The atom is the basic unit of matter.
Atoms consist of:
- Protons (positive charge)
- Electrons (negative charge)
- Neutrons (no charge)

The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. Electrons revolve around the nucleus in energy levels.

Atomic Number:
Atomic number (Z) is the number of protons in an atom.
In a neutral atom, number of protons equals number of electrons.

Mass Number:
Mass number (A) = number of protons + number of neutrons.

Electronic Configuration:
Arrangement of electrons in shells.
Maximum electrons per shell:
K = 2
L = 8
M = 18
N = 32

Example:
Sodium (Na) → 2, 8, 1

Periodic Table:
Elements are arranged by increasing atomic number.
- Periods indicate number of shells
- Groups indicate number of valence electrons

Isotopes:
Atoms of the same element with same atomic number but different mass numbers.
Example: Protium, Deuterium, Tritium

Metals, Non-metals, Metalloids:
- Metals: good conductors, malleable
- Non-metals: poor conductors, brittle
- Metalloids: properties of both

Valency:
Valency is the combining capacity of an element.
Examples:
H2O – Water
NaCl – Sodium chloride
CaO – Calcium oxide
