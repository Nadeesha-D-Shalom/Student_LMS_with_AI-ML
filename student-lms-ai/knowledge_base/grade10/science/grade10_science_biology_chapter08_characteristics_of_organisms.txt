Chapter 08: Characteristics of Organisms

The common characteristics of living organisms are:
- Cellular organization
- Nutrition
- Respiration
- Irritability and coordination
- Excretion
- Movement
- Reproduction
- Growth and development

Cellular Organization:
The smallest structural and functional unit of life is the cell. Unicellular organisms consist of a single cell. Multicellular organisms consist of tissues, organs and systems.

Nutrition:
The process by which organisms obtain energy and materials required for life is called nutrition. Plants are autotrophic. Animals are heterotrophic.

Respiration:
The process by which energy is released from food inside cells is called respiration. Oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide is released during respiration.

Irritability and Coordination:
The ability of organisms to respond to stimuli is called irritability. Coordination involves nerves, muscles and hormones.

Excretion:
Removal of waste products produced during metabolism is called excretion.

Movement:
Movement is a characteristic of all living organisms. It may involve movement of the whole body or parts of the body.

Reproduction:
Reproduction is the process by which organisms produce new individuals of the same species.

Growth and Development:
Growth is the irreversible increase in size or mass. Development is the increase in complexity of structure.

Virus:
Viruses are acellular. They show living and non-living characteristics. Reproduction occurs only inside a host cell.
