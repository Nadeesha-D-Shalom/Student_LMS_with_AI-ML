Topic: Motion in a Straight Line

Distance and Displacement:
Distance is the total length of the path travelled by an object and depends on the path taken.
Displacement is the shortest straight-line distance between the initial and final positions and has direction.

Scalar and Vector Quantities:
Scalar quantities have magnitude only.
Examples: distance, speed, mass, time.
Vector quantities have both magnitude and direction.
Examples: displacement, velocity, acceleration.

Speed:
Speed is the rate at which distance is travelled.
Speed = distance / time
Speed is a scalar quantity.
Uniform speed occurs when equal distances are travelled in equal time intervals.
Average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time.

Velocity:
Velocity is the rate of change of displacement.
Velocity = displacement / time
Velocity is a vector quantity.
Uniform velocity occurs when displacement changes equally in equal time intervals.

Acceleration:
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
Acceleration = change in velocity / time
Unit of acceleration is m s⁻².
Negative acceleration is called deceleration.

Displacement–Time Graphs:
A straight line indicates uniform velocity.
The gradient of the graph represents velocity.

Velocity–Time Graphs:
The gradient of a velocity–time graph represents acceleration.
The area under the velocity–time graph represents displacement.

Gravitational Acceleration:
The acceleration due to gravity is denoted by g.
The average value of g near the Earth’s surface is approximately 9.8 m s⁻².
A freely falling body increases its velocity by 9.8 m s⁻¹ every second.

Summary:
Distance is a scalar quantity.
Displacement, velocity, and acceleration are vector quantities.
Speed describes how fast an object moves.
Velocity describes speed with direction.
Acceleration describes how velocity changes with time.
