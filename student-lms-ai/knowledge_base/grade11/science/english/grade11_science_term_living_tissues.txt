Plant Tissue Classification:
Plant tissues are classified as meristematic tissues and permanent tissues based on cell division ability.

Meristematic Tissue Identification:
Meristematic tissues consist of small living cells with distinct nucleus, no prominent intercellular spaces and active mitotic division.

Permanent Tissue Identification:
Permanent tissues are differentiated tissues that have lost the ability to divide and perform specific functions.

Simple Permanent Tissues:
Parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma are simple permanent tissues composed of one type of cell.

Complex Permanent Tissues:
Xylem and phloem are complex permanent tissues composed of different cell types working together.

Animal Tissue Classification:
Animal tissues are epithelial, connective, muscle and nervous tissues.

Epithelial Tissue Characteristics:
Epithelial tissue has tightly packed cells on a basement membrane with no blood supply.

Connective Tissue Characteristics:
Connective tissue consists of cells and fibres embedded in matrix and provides support and connection.

Muscle Tissue Characteristics:
Muscle tissue has contractile ability and includes smooth, skeletal and cardiac muscles.

Nervous Tissue Characteristics:
Nervous tissue consists of neurons specialized for impulse transmission.

Neuron Types:
Sensory neurons carry impulses to the central nervous system, motor neurons carry impulses to effectors, and interneurons connect neurons within the CNS.
