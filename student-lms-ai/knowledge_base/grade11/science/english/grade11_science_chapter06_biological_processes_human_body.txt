Topic: Biological Processes in the Human Body

Digestion:
Digestion is the process of converting complex food substances into simple soluble substances that can be absorbed by the body. Digestion occurs through physical digestion and chemical digestion. Physical digestion increases the surface area of food particles.

Human Digestive System:
The digestive system consists of the mouth, buccal cavity, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. Accessory glands include salivary glands, liver and pancreas.

Buccal Cavity:
Physical digestion begins in the buccal cavity by teeth. Saliva contains the enzyme ptyalin which initiates chemical digestion of starch.

Oesophagus:
The oesophagus connects the mouth to the stomach. Food is transported through the oesophagus by peristaltic movements.

Stomach:
The stomach stores food and mixes it with gastric juice. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and enzymes. Protein digestion begins in the stomach.

Small Intestine:
The small intestine is the main site of digestion and absorption. Enzymes from pancreas and intestinal glands complete digestion. Villi and microvilli increase absorption efficiency.

Large Intestine:
The large intestine absorbs water and minerals. Undigested material is converted into faeces and expelled from the body.

Respiration:
Respiration is the process by which energy is released from food substances. It includes breathing and cellular respiration.

Human Respiratory System:
The respiratory system consists of nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli and lungs. It supplies oxygen to blood and removes carbon dioxide.

Inhalation:
Inhalation occurs when intercostal muscles and diaphragm contract. The volume of the thoracic cavity increases and air enters the lungs.

Exhalation:
Exhalation occurs when intercostal muscles and diaphragm relax. The volume of the thoracic cavity decreases and air is expelled from the lungs.

Respiratory Diseases:
Diseases of the respiratory system include pneumonia, bronchitis, lung cancer and tuberculosis. Smoking is a major cause of respiratory diseases.

Excretion:
Excretion is the removal of metabolic waste products from the body. Excretory organs include kidneys, lungs and skin.

Human Excretory System:
The excretory system consists of kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder and urethra. Kidneys filter blood and form urine.

Nephron:
The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. Urine formation occurs through ultrafiltration, selective reabsorption and secretion.

Ultrafiltration:
Blood is filtered from the glomerulus into Bowman’s capsule under high pressure.

Selective Reabsorption:
Useful substances such as glucose, amino acids, water and ions are reabsorbed into the blood from the nephron.

Secretion:
Certain substances such as ammonia, drugs and excess ions are secreted into the nephron tubule.

Composition of Urine:
Urine contains water, urea, uric acid, creatinine, salts and ammonia.

Circulation:
The circulatory system transports substances throughout the body. It consists of heart, blood and blood vessels.

Blood:
Blood is a connective tissue composed of plasma and cells. It transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones and waste products.

Diseases of the Circulatory System:
Diseases include heart disease, hypertension and blood disorders. Prevention includes balanced diet, exercise and regular medical checkups.

Coordination and Homeostasis:
Coordination maintains internal balance in the body. Nervous and hormonal systems regulate body functions and maintain homeostasis.
