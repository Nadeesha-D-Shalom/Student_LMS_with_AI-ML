Topic: Geometrical Optics

Nature of Light:
Light is a form of energy that enables vision. It travels in straight lines in a homogeneous medium. The behaviour of light can be studied using geometrical optics.

Reflection of Light:
Reflection is the bouncing back of light from a surface. A smooth surface produces regular reflection, while a rough surface produces irregular reflection.

Laws of Reflection:
The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal lie in the same plane. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

Plane Mirrors:
A plane mirror forms an upright, virtual image of the same size as the object. The image is laterally inverted.

Curved Mirrors:
Curved mirrors include concave and convex mirrors. The pole, centre of curvature, radius of curvature and focal point are important parts of curved mirrors.

Image Formation by Concave Mirrors:
The nature and size of images depend on the position of the object. Images can be real or virtual, inverted or upright, and magnified or diminished.

Image Formation by Convex Mirrors:
Convex mirrors always form virtual, upright and diminished images regardless of object position.

Applications of Curved Mirrors:
Concave mirrors are used in headlights and shaving mirrors. Convex mirrors are used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles.

Refraction of Light:
Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another due to a change in speed.

Refractive Index:
The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.

Effects of Refraction:
Objects under water appear raised. A pencil placed in water appears bent. These effects occur due to refraction.

Lenses:
Lenses are transparent optical devices that refract light. Convex lenses converge light while concave lenses diverge light.

Image Formation by Lenses:
The position and nature of images depend on object distance and focal length of the lens.

Optical Instruments:
Microscopes, telescopes and cameras use lenses to form images. These instruments help observe very small or distant objects.
