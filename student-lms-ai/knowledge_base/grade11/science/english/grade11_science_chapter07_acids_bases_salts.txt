Topic: Acids, Bases and Salts

Introduction:
Acids, bases and salts are widely used in daily life. They play an important role in food, medicine, agriculture and industry. Understanding their properties helps to use them safely and effectively.

Acids:
An acid is a compound that releases hydrogen ions in an aqueous medium. Hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and sulphuric acid are commonly used laboratory acids.

Ionisation of Acids:
Hydrochloric acid ionises in water to produce hydrogen ions and chloride ions. Hydrogen ions are responsible for acidic properties.

Strong Acids:
Strong acids release hydrogen ions by complete ionisation in aqueous solution. Examples include hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid.

Weak Acids:
Weak acids release hydrogen ions by partial ionisation. Examples include acetic acid, carbonic acid and phosphoric acid.

Properties of Acids:
Acids are corrosive and can damage skin, metals and fabrics. They have a sour taste. Dilute acids react with metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series to produce hydrogen gas. Acids react with carbonates and bicarbonates to produce carbon dioxide. Acids turn blue litmus red.

Uses of Acids:
Hydrochloric acid is used to remove rust and prepare gelatin. Sulphuric acid is used in fertilizer production, batteries and as a dehydrating agent. Acetic acid is used in food processing, rubber coagulation and paper industry.

Bases:
A base is a compound that increases hydroxyl ion concentration in aqueous solution. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonia are common bases.

Ionisation of Bases:
Sodium hydroxide ionises in water to release hydroxyl ions, increasing basicity.

Strong Bases:
Strong bases completely ionise in aqueous solution. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are strong bases.

Weak Bases:
Weak bases partially ionise in aqueous solution. Ammonia solution is a weak base.

Properties of Bases:
Bases have a slippery or soapy feel. They react with acids to form salts and water. Bases turn red litmus blue. Water-soluble bases are called alkalis.

Uses of Bases:
Sodium hydroxide is used in soap, paper, textile and petroleum industries. Magnesium hydroxide is used as an antacid and in sugar purification.

Indicators:
Indicators are substances that change colour in acidic and basic media. They help identify acids and bases.

Common Indicators:
Litmus turns red in acids and blue in bases. Phenolphthalein is colourless in acids and pink in bases. Methyl orange is red in acids and yellow in bases.

pH Scale:
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. pH 7 represents neutrality. Values below 7 indicate acidity and values above 7 indicate basicity.

pH Papers:
pH papers contain mixed indicators. They give approximate pH values and indicate the strength of acids and bases.

Salts:
Salts are formed when acids react with bases. Sodium chloride is a common salt used daily. Salts are crystalline solids and most dissolve in water.

Nature of Salts:
Salts may be acidic, basic or neutral depending on the strength of the acid and base used to form them. Salts formed from strong acids and strong bases are neutral.

Uses of Salts:
Sodium chloride is used for food flavouring, preservation and chemical production. Copper sulphate is used as a fungicide, in electroplating and paint industry.

Neutralisation:
Neutralisation is the reaction between hydrogen ions of acids and hydroxyl ions of bases to form water. Salt is also produced during the reaction.

Applications of Neutralisation:
Antacids neutralise stomach acidity. Lime is added to soil to reduce acidity. Baking soda is used to treat bee stings. Vinegar or lime juice is used to treat wasp stings.

Summary:
Acids release hydrogen ions and bases release hydroxyl ions in aqueous solutions. Strong and weak acids and bases differ by degree of ionisation. Indicators help identify acids and bases. pH scale indicates acidity and basicity. Salts are products of acid-base reactions and neutralisation removes acidic and basic properties.
