Grade 11 Science – Unit 11.6
Unit: Biological Processes in Human Body
Topic: Practical Activities on Digestion, Respiration, Excretion and Circulation

Digestion:
Digestion is the process by which complex organic food substances are broken down into simple soluble substances that can be absorbed by the body. Digestion occurs through physical digestion and chemical digestion. Physical digestion begins in the buccal cavity by the action of teeth. Chemical digestion begins in the buccal cavity by the action of enzymes.

Activity 11.6.1 Digestion in the Buccal Cavity:
A small amount of rice is kept in the mouth without chewing and the time taken to feel sweetness is observed. The mouth is washed and the same amount of rice is chewed well and the time taken to feel sweetness is observed again. Sweetness is felt faster when rice is chewed due to increased surface area. Digestion by teeth is called physical digestion. Chemical digestion begins in the buccal cavity due to the enzyme ptyalin present in saliva.

Digestion of Starch in the Mouth:
Ptyalin digests starch into maltose. Maltose is a simple sugar and has a sweet taste. Therefore sweetness is felt when starch is digested in the mouth.

Activity 11.6.2 Peristaltic Movements:
A glass ball is inserted into a rubber tube and pushed down slowly. The rubber tube represents the oesophagus. Food is transferred from the mouth to the stomach through the oesophagus by peristaltic movements. These movements occur due to contraction and relaxation of muscles in the oesophageal wall.

Activity 11.6.3 Structure of Villi:
A cardboard and coloured paper model is used to demonstrate villi in the small intestine. Villi increase the internal surface area of the small intestine. Increased surface area improves absorption efficiency. Adaptations include presence of villi and microvilli, thin walls, rich blood supply and long length of small intestine.

Activity 11.6.4 Carbon Dioxide in Exhaled Air:
Two polythene bags are filled separately with atmospheric air and exhaled air. Lime water is added to both. Lime water turns milky faster in the bag with exhaled air. Exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than inhaled air. Carbon dioxide reacts with lime water to form calcium carbonate.

Chemical Reaction of Lime Water:
Calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate and water. The formation of calcium carbonate causes the milky appearance.

Activity 11.6.5 Volume of Air in Lungs:
A calibrated bottle setup is used to measure lung capacity. Air blown into the bottle displaces water. The displaced volume approximately equals lung capacity. Lung capacity varies with age, gender and physical activity. Regular exercise increases lung capacity.

Respiratory Diseases:
Smoking affects the respiratory system severely. Both active and passive smoking damage lungs, heart and other organs. Respiratory diseases include pneumonia, bronchitis, lung cancer and tuberculosis.

Activity 11.6.6 Excretory Substances in Sweat and Urine:
A drop of sweat or urine is placed on a glass slide and heated. After evaporation, white residues remain. Sweat and urine contain dissolved salts and nitrogenous wastes.

Excretory Substances:
Urine contains urea, uric acid, creatinine, salts and water. Sweat contains water, salts and small amounts of urea.

Activity 11.6.7 Blood Testing:
Blood tests are used to diagnose diseases related to blood and circulatory system. Tests include ECG, blood glucose, cholesterol profile, liver function tests, full blood count, urea and electrolyte tests and BNP tests.

Evaluation:
Questions are based on digestive system, respiratory system, excretory system, blood circulatory system and coordination and homeostasis. Past examination questions are used for assessment.
