Temperature:
Temperature is the physical quantity that describes the degree of hotness or coldness of an object. It is a fundamental property of matter and depends on the mean kinetic energy of the particles that form the object. Objects with higher particle kinetic energy have higher temperatures.

Measuring Temperature:
Touch can give only a rough idea about temperature and cannot provide numerical values. Therefore, instruments called thermometers are used to measure temperature accurately.

Thermometers:
A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. The first thermometer was invented by Galileo Galilei around 1600 AD. Several types of thermometers are used today.

Glass–Mercury Thermometer:
A glass–mercury thermometer consists of a bulb filled with mercury connected to a narrow capillary tube. When temperature increases, mercury expands and rises along the tube. Mercury is suitable because it expands uniformly and remains liquid over a wide temperature range.

Glass–Alcohol Thermometer:
In this thermometer, ethanol is used instead of mercury. Ethanol has a very low melting point and is suitable for measuring very low temperatures. Since ethanol is colourless, it is dyed to make it visible.

Digital Thermometer:
Digital thermometers measure temperature using electrical properties that vary with temperature. The temperature can be read directly from a digital display.

Temperature Scales:
The commonly used temperature scales are Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Fixed points are used to define these scales.

Celsius Scale:
In the Celsius scale, the melting point of ice is taken as 0 °C and the boiling point of water as 100 °C at atmospheric pressure. The interval between these points is divided into 100 equal parts.

Fahrenheit Scale:
In the Fahrenheit scale, the melting point of ice is 32 °F and the boiling point of water is 212 °F. The interval between these points is divided into 180 equal parts.

Kelvin Scale:
The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature. Absolute zero is −273.15 °C. In the Kelvin scale, a temperature difference of 1 K is equal to a temperature difference of 1 °C. The SI unit of temperature is Kelvin.

Relationship Between Celsius and Kelvin:
To convert Celsius to Kelvin, 273 is added. To convert Kelvin to Celsius, 273 is subtracted.

Heat:
Heat is the energy transferred from one object to another due to a temperature difference. Heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature until thermal equilibrium is reached.

Thermal Equilibrium:
When two bodies in contact reach the same temperature, heat transfer stops. This state is known as thermal equilibrium.

Units of Heat:
Heat is a form of energy and is measured in joules. The calorie is also used as a unit of heat.

Heat Capacity:
Heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of an object by one degree. It depends on the mass and the material of the object.

Specific Heat Capacity:
Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of a substance by one degree. It is a property of the substance. The unit is J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹.

Relationship Between Heat, Mass and Temperature Change:
The quantity of heat absorbed or released is given by Q = mcθ, where m is mass, c is specific heat capacity and θ is temperature change.

Change of State of Matter:
Matter exists as solids, liquids and gases. A change of state occurs when a substance changes from one state to another by absorbing or releasing heat.

Melting Point:
The melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes into a liquid. It depends on pressure.

Freezing Point:
The freezing point is the temperature at which a liquid changes into a solid. It has the same value as the melting point.

Boiling Point:
The boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid changes into vapour by forming bubbles throughout the liquid.

Latent Heat:
Latent heat is the heat absorbed or released during a change of state without a change in temperature.

Latent Heat of Fusion:
The latent heat of fusion is the heat required to convert a solid at its melting point into a liquid at the same temperature.

Latent Heat of Vaporization:
The latent heat of vaporization is the heat required to convert a liquid at its boiling point into a gas at the same temperature.

Evaporation:
Evaporation is the conversion of a liquid into vapour at temperatures below its boiling point. It occurs at the surface of the liquid and causes cooling.

Thermal Expansion:
Thermal expansion is the increase in length, area or volume of a substance when its temperature increases. Contraction occurs when temperature decreases.

Expansion of Solids:
Solids expand when heated and contract when cooled. This property is applied in railway tracks, bridges, bottle lids and bimetallic strips.

Expansion of Liquids:
Liquids expand when heated. This property is used in liquid thermometers.

Expansion of Gases:
Gases expand when heated and contract when cooled. This can be demonstrated using a bottle and a balloon.

Heat Transfer:
Heat transfer is the flow of heat from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. There are three methods of heat transfer.

Conduction:
Conduction is the transfer of heat through solids by particle collisions and free electrons in metals. Metals are good conductors, while wood and plastic are insulators.

Convection:
Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of fluids. It occurs in liquids and gases due to density differences.

Sea Breeze and Land Breeze:
Sea breeze occurs during daytime when air moves from sea to land. Land breeze occurs at night when air moves from land to sea due to temperature differences.

Radiation:
Radiation is the transfer of heat in the form of electromagnetic waves without a material medium. Dark surfaces absorb heat effectively, while shiny surfaces reflect heat.
