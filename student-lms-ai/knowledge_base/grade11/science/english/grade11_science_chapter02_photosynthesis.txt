Modes of Nutrition:
Food is essential for the survival of all living organisms. Some organisms depend on other organisms for food, and this mode of nutrition is known as heterotrophic nutrition. Animals such as cows and storks obtain food from other organisms. Green plants produce their own food, and this mode of nutrition is called autotrophic nutrition.

Photosynthesis:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants synthesize food using carbon dioxide and water by utilizing energy from sunlight in the presence of chlorophyll. This process takes place in chloroplasts of plant cells. The food produced during photosynthesis supports all living organisms directly or indirectly.

Raw Materials for Photosynthesis:
Water required for photosynthesis is absorbed from the soil through root hairs by osmosis. The absorbed water passes through the cortex and endodermis into the xylem and is transported to the leaves through the stem and leaf veins. Carbon dioxide required for photosynthesis diffuses from the atmosphere into the leaf through stomata and reaches mesophyll cells via intercellular spaces.

Role of Chlorophyll:
Chlorophyll is a green pigment present in chloroplasts. It absorbs energy from sunlight, which is essential for the synthesis of food during photosynthesis.

Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:
The main factors affecting photosynthesis are chlorophyll, sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. Absence of any one of these factors prevents photosynthesis.

Activity to Observe Chloroplast Movement:
Chloroplasts in Hydrilla or Vallisneria leaf cells move towards the direction of sunlight to maximize absorption of light energy for photosynthesis.

Products of Photosynthesis:
The main product of photosynthesis is glucose. Glucose is temporarily stored as starch in leaves. Part of the starch is converted into sucrose and transported to other parts of the plant through phloem. In storage organs such as fruits, roots and tubers, sucrose is again converted into starch. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of photosynthesis through stomata.

Word Equation of Photosynthesis:
Carbon dioxide and water, in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll, produce glucose and oxygen.

Chemical Equation of Photosynthesis:
6CO2 (g) + 6H2O (l) in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll produce C6H12O6 (s) and 6O2 (g).

Light Absorption in Photosynthesis:
Plants absorb red and blue light of sunlight during photosynthesis.

Test for Starch:
Starch produced during photosynthesis can be tested using iodine solution. A blue or dark purple colour indicates the presence of starch.

Activity to Test Starch in a Leaf:
A leaf exposed to sunlight is boiled in water, then in alcohol using a water bath to remove chlorophyll. When iodine solution is added, the leaf turns blue or dark purple if starch is present.

Need for Sunlight:
A plant kept in darkness for 48 hours loses stored starch. When part of a leaf is covered with black polythene and exposed to sunlight, starch is produced only in the uncovered regions. This shows that sunlight is required for photosynthesis.

Need for Carbon Dioxide:
When a leaf is placed in a polythene bag containing potassium hydroxide, which absorbs carbon dioxide, starch is not produced. A leaf receiving carbon dioxide produces starch. This shows that carbon dioxide is required for photosynthesis.

Need for Chlorophyll:
In mosaic leaves, starch is produced only in green regions. White regions lacking chlorophyll do not produce starch. This shows that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.

Need for Water:
The need for water cannot be tested directly in the laboratory because plants die without water. Scientists have demonstrated the requirement of water using isotopic studies.

Oxygen as a Byproduct:
During photosynthesis, oxygen gas is released. This can be demonstrated using an aquatic plant where gas collected burns a glowing splinter brightly, confirming the presence of oxygen.

Discovery Related to Oxygen Release:
Lavoisier was the first scientist to show that oxygen diffuses from green plants in the presence of sunlight.

Importance of Photosynthesis:
Photosynthesis converts solar energy into chemical energy. It provides food for all organisms either directly or indirectly. It releases oxygen required for respiration and combustion. It removes excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and maintains the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis plays a major role in maintaining the carbon cycle and sustaining life on Earth.
