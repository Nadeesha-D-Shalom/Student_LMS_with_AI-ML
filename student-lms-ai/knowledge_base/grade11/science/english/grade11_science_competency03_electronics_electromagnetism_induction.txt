Topic: Electronics, Electromagnetism and Electromagnetic Induction

Semiconductors:
Semiconductors are materials that conduct electricity better than insulators but less than conductors. Silicon and germanium are common semiconductors. Their conductivity can be increased by doping.

Intrinsic Semiconductors:
Intrinsic semiconductors are pure semiconductors in which free electrons and holes exist in equal numbers.

Extrinsic Semiconductors:
Extrinsic semiconductors are formed by doping intrinsic semiconductors with impurities. N-type semiconductors have excess free electrons, while P-type semiconductors have excess holes.

Junction Diodes:
A junction diode allows current to flow in one direction only. This property is used in rectification.

Rectification:
Rectification is the process of converting alternating current into direct current. Half-wave rectification allows current in one half cycle, while full-wave rectification allows current in both half cycles.

Transistors:
A transistor is a semiconductor device used as a switch or amplifier. It consists of emitter, base and collector regions.

Transistor as a Switch:
A transistor can control current flow in a circuit. A small base voltage can switch a larger current on or off.

Transistor as an Amplifier:
When a small input signal is applied to the base, a larger output signal is produced at the collector. This is known as amplification.

Magnetic Effect of Current:
A magnetic field is produced around a current-carrying conductor. The direction depends on the direction of current flow.

Force on a Current Carrying Conductor:
A conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force when current flows through it. This principle is used in motors and loudspeakers.

Electromagnetic Induction:
A current is induced in a conductor when the magnetic field linked with it changes. This principle is used in generators and transformers.

Applications of Electromagnetic Induction:
Electromagnetic induction is used in electric generators, transformers, bicycle dynamos and microphones.

Transformers:
Transformers operate only with alternating current. They are used to increase or decrease voltage levels efficiently.

Energy Transformation:
In generators, mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy. In motors, electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy.
