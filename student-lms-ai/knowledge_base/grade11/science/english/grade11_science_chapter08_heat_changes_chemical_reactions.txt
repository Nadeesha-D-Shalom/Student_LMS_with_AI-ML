Topic: Heat Changes Associated with Chemical Reactions

Heat Changes in Chemical Reactions:
During every chemical reaction, a heat change occurs. The temperature change indicates whether heat is absorbed or released.

Exothermic Reactions:
Exothermic reactions are reactions in which heat is released to the surroundings. In these reactions, the energy content of the products is lower than that of the reactants.

Example of an Exothermic Reaction:
When magnesium reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid, heat is released and the temperature increases. The reaction produces magnesium chloride and hydrogen gas.

Energy Level Diagram of Exothermic Reactions:
In an exothermic reaction, the energy level of the products is lower than that of the reactants. The excess energy is released as heat.

Endothermic Reactions:
Endothermic reactions are reactions in which heat is absorbed from the surroundings. In these reactions, the energy content of the products is higher than that of the reactants.

Example of an Endothermic Reaction:
When citric acid reacts with sodium bicarbonate, the temperature decreases due to absorption of heat.

Energy Level Diagram of Endothermic Reactions:
In an endothermic reaction, the energy level of the products is higher than that of the reactants, showing absorption of energy.

Measurement of Heat Change:
Heat change in a reaction can be calculated using Q = mcθ. This calculation assumes no heat loss to surroundings.

Experimental Determination of Heat Change:
The reaction between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid is used to measure heat change. Equal volumes of solutions are mixed and the maximum temperature is recorded.

Heat of Neutralisation:
The heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base is called the heat of neutralisation.

Importance of Physical States:
When expressing heat changes, the physical states of reactants and products must be stated because heat changes vary with physical state.

Applications of Exothermic Reactions:
Combustion of fuels, neutralisation reactions, cellular respiration and slaked lime production are exothermic reactions.

Applications of Endothermic Reactions:
Photosynthesis and thermal decomposition of compounds such as calcium carbonate are endothermic processes.

Summary of Heat Changes:
Chemical reactions involve heat changes. Exothermic reactions release heat and endothermic reactions absorb heat. Heat changes can be calculated quantitatively using experimental data.
