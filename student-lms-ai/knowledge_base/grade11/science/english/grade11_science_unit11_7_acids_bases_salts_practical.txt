Topic: Acid, Base and Salts – Practical Activities

Introduction:
Acids, bases and salts are commonly used substances in daily life. Their properties can be identified through simple experiments using household materials and indicators. Practical activities help to understand reactions of acids, bases and salts and their applications.

Activity 11.7.1 Reaction of an Acid at Home:
Lime juice, baking soda, soap water and a transparent glass are used for this activity. Lime juice is squeezed into a glass. Baking soda is added to the glass. A small amount of soap water or diluted shampoo is added and the mixture is shaken. When lime juice is added, bubbles are formed due to the release of a gas.

Observations of Activity 11.7.1:
Effervescence is observed when lime juice reacts with baking soda. A gas is evolved. Lime juice shows acidic characteristics.

Nature of Lime Juice:
Lime juice is an acid because it releases hydrogen ions in aqueous solution.

Gas Evolved:
Carbon dioxide gas is evolved when an acid reacts with a carbonate or bicarbonate.

Chemical Nature of Baking Soda:
Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. It reacts with acids to release carbon dioxide gas.

Examples of Weak Acids at Home:
Lime juice, vinegar, tamarind juice and bilimbi juice are weak acids found at home.

Activity 11.7.2 Differentiation of Acids and Bases Using Indicators:
Lime juice or vinegar, soap water, turmeric solution and yoghurt cups are used. Solutions are placed in cups. Turmeric solution is added dropwise and changes are observed.

Observations with Turmeric Indicator:
Turmeric remains yellow in acidic solutions such as vinegar. It turns reddish brown in basic solutions such as soap water.

Indicators:
Indicators are chemical substances that change colour in acids and bases. They help to identify acidic and basic substances.

Types of Indicators:
Indicators are classified as natural indicators and artificial indicators. Turmeric solution, blue pea flower solution and shoe flower solution are natural indicators. Litmus, phenolphthalein and methyl orange are artificial indicators.

Laboratory Indicators:
Litmus turns red in acids and blue in bases. Phenolphthalein is colourless in acids and pink in bases. Methyl orange is red in acids and yellow in bases.

Activity 11.7.3 Determination of Strength of Acids and Bases:
Red cabbage solution is prepared and added to different solutions such as water, vinegar, lime juice, baking powder and washing powder. Colour changes are observed and compared.

Observations Using Red Cabbage Indicator:
Different colours indicate different strengths of acidic and basic solutions. Strong acids and bases show more intense colour changes.

pH Scale:
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. pH 7 indicates neutrality. Values less than 7 indicate acidity and values greater than 7 indicate basicity.

Use of pH Papers:
pH papers are prepared using mixed indicators. They provide an approximate value of pH and indicate the strength of acids and bases.

Evaluation:
Questions are based on identification of acids and bases, indicators, strength of acids and bases and pH scale understanding.
