Grade 11 Science – Competency Levels 4.1 to 4.5
Unit: Biology
Topic: Biosphere, Environmental Balance and Sustainable Development

Organizational Levels of the Biosphere:
The biosphere consists of physical and biological components interacting for life. These interactions occur at individual, population, community, ecosystem and biosphere levels.

Population Growth and Density:
Population density is the number of individuals per unit area. It is affected by births, deaths, immigration and emigration.

Growth Curves:
Natural populations show sigmoid growth curves, while human populations show J-shaped growth due to technological and medical advancements.

Food Chains and Food Webs:
Energy flows through ecosystems via food chains and interconnected food webs. Producers form the base, followed by consumers and decomposers.

Ecological Pyramids:
Number, biomass and energy pyramids illustrate trophic relationships. Energy pyramids are always upright due to energy loss.

Energy Flow and Dissipation:
Only 10% of energy passes to the next trophic level. Energy loss limits food chain length.

Biogeochemical Cycles:
Carbon and nitrogen cycles ensure continuous circulation of essential elements in ecosystems.

Environmental Pollution:
Environmental pollution results from agrochemicals, industrial waste, greenhouse gases, heavy metals, particulate matter, domestic waste and electronic waste.

Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming:
Excess greenhouse gases cause global warming, leading to climate change, sea level rise and glacial melting.

Acid Rain and Ozone Depletion:
Acid rain damages ecosystems and structures. Ozone depletion allows harmful UV radiation to reach Earth.

Biomagnification and Eutrophication:
Toxic substances accumulate along food chains, while nutrient enrichment causes eutrophication in water bodies.

Lifestyle Changes and Diseases:
Industrialization and urbanization contribute to non-contagious diseases such as diabetes, cancers and kidney diseases.

Sustainable Development:
Sustainable development ensures resource use without harming future generations.

Environmental Management:
Environmental management includes waste management, energy efficiency, traditional practices and conservation strategies.

Waste Management Principles:
Reduce, reuse, replace and recycle are essential for minimizing environmental impact.

Energy Management and Conservation:
Efficient energy use, renewable energy adoption and energy auditing reduce energy crisis risks.
