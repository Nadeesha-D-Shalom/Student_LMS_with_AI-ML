      <p>
        This Learning Management System (LMS) is designed to help students manage
        their academic activities in one centralized platform. It reduces the
        need to switch between multiple tools for classes, assignments,
        communication, and progress tracking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many students face challenges such as missing deadlines, losing study
        materials, unclear communication with instructors, and difficulty
        tracking academic progress. This LMS addresses those problems by
        organizing learning resources, assessments, and schedules in a clear
        and structured way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dashboard provides an overview of your daily academic priorities,
        including upcoming classes, pending assignments, and recent
        announcements. This helps you focus on what matters most without
        unnecessary distractions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Features such as assignments, quizzes, messages, and announcements are
        grouped logically to make navigation intuitive. The goal is to minimize
        confusion and allow students to spend more time learning rather than
        searching for information.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you experience technical issues or have questions about using the
        system, please contact your institution’s academic or technical support
        team for assistance.
